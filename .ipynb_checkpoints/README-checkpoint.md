# Aviation Accident Risk Analysis


## Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering incidents from 1962 to 2023.

The goal is to identify low-risk aircraft models to support our company's expansion into the aviation industry. The analysis involves data cleaning, imputation, visualization, and business intelligence insights to guide decision-making.
## Business Understanding

The stakeholders in this analysis include airline companies, aviation safety regulators, aircraft manufacturers, and insurance companies.

Key Business questions:
1. What are the key risk factors leading to injuries and fatalities?
2. What changes can be made to improve aviation safety?
## Data Understanding

 The dataset used is from the National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB) and has aviation data from the year 1962 to 2023.

**The three features highly focused on in this project are:** 
1. Aircraft model 
2. Aircraft category
3. Aircfat make
4. Event date
.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Focusing on the chosen features (Event date, aircraft model, make and category) to analyse and visualize the data.
 
 1. Injury Trends over Time

2.![Injuries per category](injury_per_category.png)

3.![Injuries per Aircraft Make](injury_per_make.png)

4.![Injury by Make-model](injuries_by_make_model.png)

A dashboard is build for this, explore it [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucy.mutua/viz/AviationAccidentRiskAnalysis_17431941135170/AviationAccidents)

## Conclusion

### Findings and Recommendations

Writing down the findings from the visualizations and analysis. 
Giving recommendations based on the findings.

**Finding 1:** Injuries have significantlly decreased over Time.

**Recommendation:** The company should have pilot training programs, aircraft maintenance training as well as choose aircrafts with established safety procedures.

**Finding 2:** Aircraft Category Plays a Major Role in Safety.

**Recommendation:**The company should select models with improved safety records, cutting-edge safety measures, and reduced accident rates.

**Finding 3:** Aircraft Make Influences Safety Performance.

**Recommendation:** The company should focus on aircraft manufacturers with strong safety records and lower historical injury counts.
